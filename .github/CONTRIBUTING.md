# Contributing to razor-go
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed commands, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

PS: make sure that your commits are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification). Only signed commits can be merged to the `main` branch.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/razor-network/razor-go/issues)
If you've found something wrong we want to know about it, please help us understand the problem so we can resolve it.

1. Check to see if this already is recorded, if so add some more information [issue list](https://github.com/razor-network/razor-go/issues) 
2. If not then create a new issue using the [bug report template](https://github.com/razor-network/razor-go/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Abug&template=bug.md&title=)
3. Stay involved in the conversation on the issue as it is triaged and progressed.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We aim to maintain a very high standard of code, through design, test and implementation.
To manage this we have various checks and processes in place that everyone should follow, including:

* We use the Go standard format (with tabs not spaces) - you can run `gofmt` before committing
* Everything should have a unit test attached (as much as possible, to keep our coverage up)
